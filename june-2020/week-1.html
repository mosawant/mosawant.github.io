  <h1>Week 1 - 8 June 2020</h1>
  <p>I aim to get a proper website set up here but for now I am doing this all the old-fashioned route typing into the text editor. To me this is more important to get the basics of notes down rather than a flashy website. This is more for my benefit right now. Then when I get to the point where I can give something back and share whatever knowledge and experience I have gained, I will have my website sorted.</p>
  <h2>Cyber Mentor Udemy Course</h2>
  <p>Number 1 on my list has been the Practical Ethical Hacking Course by The Cyber Mentor.</p>
  <h2>Web Application Hacker Handbook</h2>
  <p>This is the free PDF book that you get when joining Hacker One. I have not had much chance to look through this. I had started but now i find the Udemy course more useful to start with and when I looked again at the book things made a little more sense.</p>
  <h2>STOK - YouTuber/Vlogger Hacker</h2>
  <p>One of the first things I did was join Twitter to follow other hackers and get some insights. And so I cam across this YouTuber STOK. So far I have watched one video on his top tips for starting out.</p>

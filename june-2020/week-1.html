  <h1>Week 1 - 8 June 2020</h1>
  <p>I aim to get a proper website set up here but for now I am doing this all the old-fashioned route typing into the text editor. To me this is more important to get the basics of notes down rather than a flashy website. This is more for my benefit right now. Then when I get to the point where I can give something back and share whatever knowledge and experience I have gained, I will have my website sorted.</p>
  <h2>Cyber Mentor Udemy Course</h2>
  <p>Number 1 on my list has been the <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/">Practical Ethical Hacking Course by The Cyber Mentor</a>. I am just getting started on this and have covered up to nearly the end of Section 4 on networking. To be honest when I started this I have been unsure how useful it is, but reading round other sources (see below) I can see the need for this foundation. So I am continuing this.</p>
  <h2>Web Hacker Handbook</h2>
  <p>This is the free PDF book that you get when joining Hacker One - Peter Yaworski's Web Hacking 101. I have not had much chance to look through this. I had started but now i find the Udemy course more useful to start with and when I looked again at the book things made a little more sense.</p>
  <h2>STOK - YouTuber/Vlogger Hacker</h2>
  <p>One of the first things I did was join Twitter to follow other hackers and get some insights. I am <a href = "https://twitter.com/mosawant">@mosawant</a>. And so I cam across this YouTuber STÃ–K who is a href = "https://twitter.com/stokfredrik">@stokfredrik</a>. So far I have watched one video on his top tips for starting out - <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU9Iafc-Igs">How to get started in Bug Bounty</a>. This was good to understand some more tips. Especially that here is someone without massive coding skills who is successful and so I can see the parallels. I liked that he mentioned the need to persevere ans stay motivated but also don't stress and get burnt out. So I try this and do some study, listen to some chill music and keep going.</p>
  <h3>An aside</h3>
</p>Of course just as an aside here I have discovered that where Spotify and Amazon Music are blocked, I can still stream from SoundCloud.</p>
<p>Right now I am listening to this set called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mugatunesofficial/sets/audible-adderall-14">Audible Adderall by MugaTunes</a>. It's nice to have in the background. I like this one - <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tropixofficial/dontstartnow">Tropix & Wyle (ft. SHEE) - Don't Start Now</a>.

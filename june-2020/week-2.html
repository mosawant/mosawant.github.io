  <h1>Week 2 - 15 June 2020</h1>
  <h2>Kali Linux</h2>
  <p>I ended last week on a bit of a downer after starting on a high. I was working on the Cyber Mentor Udemy course and had got to the point of trying out Kali Linux. And then I heard him say his machine has 32GB of RAM! I was like what?! So of course I had been itching to get started and thought I would use Kali Linux on an old Raspberry Pi I had, but it was too slow. And then I bought a big USB memory stick to run it as a Live USB on my laptop. Now that worked but I'm not sure it's the best set up. I thought of giving up but I know I have to just keep going</p>
  <h2>Back at it</h2>
  <p>Now the end of the week but I'm looking again at the Udemy course.</p>

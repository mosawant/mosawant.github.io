  <h1>Week 2 - 15 June 2020</h1>
  <h2>Kali Linux</h2>
  <p>I ended last week on a bit of a downer after starting on a high. I was working on the Cyber Mentor Udemy course and had got to the point of trying out Kali Linux. And then I heard him say his machine has 32GB of RAM! I was like what?! So of course I had been itching to get started and thought I would use Kali Linux on an old Raspberry Pi I had, but it was too slow. And then I bought a big USB memory stick to run it as a Live USB on my laptop. Now that worked but I'm not sure it's the best set up. I thought of giving up but I know I have to just keep going.</p>
  <p>Now the end of the week but I'm looking again at the Udemy course.</p>
    <h3>Learning Linux</h3>
    <p><ul><li>GUI</li>
    <li>Terminal - powerful - use day-to-day</li>
    <li>Metasploit</li>
    <li>NMAP / Zenmap</li>
    <li>Burpsuite - Web Application Penetration Testing</li>
    <li>Phases of ethical hacking: 1. Information gathering... n. Reporting</li></ul></p>
    <h3>Using the Terminal</h3>
  <p><ul><li>Navigating the file system - GUI vs terminal</li>
  <li>pwd - Print working directory</li>
  <li>cd - Change directory</li>
  <li>cd .. = going backwards</li>
  <li>ls - List</li>
  <li>cd Folder name (can use tab for autocomplete)</li>
  <li>Don't need to be in an adjacent folder to cd - can use full path</li>
    <li>Similar don't need to be in folder to ls - use the path and tab (remember case sensitive)</li>
  <li>cd and double tab shows possible folders to navigate to</li>
  <li>mkdir and rmdir to make and remove directories</li>
  <li>echo "some text" > filename.txt = create file with that text</li>
  <li>cp filename location = copies file to new location</li>
  <li>mv filename location = moves file to new location</li>
  <li>Locate feature</li>
  <li>updatedb in order to locate</li>
  <li>eg locate bash</li>
  <li>passwd</li>
    <li>man pages = instructions for different commands eg man ls will give you all the additional options such as -a for all</li>
